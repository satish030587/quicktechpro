# QuickTechPro – Authentication “Must-Haves”

A robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication system is foundational to QuickTechPro’s customer and admin portals. The following **authentication “must-haves”** derive from the attached requirements and best practices:

**1. Secure Sign-Up \& Onboarding**

- Email verification with one-time confirmation link before account activation
- Optional SMS/WhatsApp OTP for phone number verification
- Profile completion flow enforcing address (for onsite eligibility) and required profile fields
- Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, character variety)

**2. Flexible Login Options**

- Traditional email/password login
- Social login (Google, Facebook) with post-OAuth profile completion step
- “Remember Me” toggle for persistent sessions
- CAPTCHA on login after several failed attempts to deter bots

**3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- Mandatory 2FA for all admin accounts (authenticator app or SMS OTP)
- Optional 2FA for customers, especially for high-value actions (e.g., payments, profile changes)
- One-click 2FA enrollment and recovery codes management

**4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Define granular roles: Super Admin, Admin, Manager, Technician, Content Moderator, Customer
- Server-side enforcement of permissions per API endpoint and UI view
- Admin UI for managing user roles, promotions, and deactivations

**5. Session \& Token Management**

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for API authentication; short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens
- Secure cookies for browser sessions (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax)
- Blacklisting/rotation of tokens on logout or password change
- Server-side session store (Redis) for forced session invalidation

**6. Password Management**

- “Forgot Password” flow with secure, single-use reset links that expire
- Password change functionality requiring current password + strength meter
- Hashing with bcrypt/Argon2 and appropriate salt rounds

**7. Account Security \& Monitoring**

- Login history display in profile (timestamps, IP, device) with remote logout option
- Rate-limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force
- Alert notifications (email/SMS) on suspicious login attempts or new device logins
- Automatic lockout after configurable failed-login threshold

**8. Consent \& Privacy**

- Explicit opt-in for marketing communications (email, SMS, WhatsApp)
- GDPR-style data access and account deletion (“Right to be forgotten”)
- Privacy policy acknowledgement during registration

**9. Secure API Endpoints**

- All auth-related endpoints served over HTTPS only
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- CSRF protection on forms (framework-provided tokens)

**10. Developer \& Admin Tools**

- Admin dashboard sections for viewing and managing user accounts, sessions, and MFA status
- Audit logs of auth events (registrations, logins, password resets, role changes)
- Configurable policies for password complexity, session timeout, and token expiry

These must-haves ensure QuickTechPro’s authentication provides security, compliance, and a seamless user experience across customer and admin portals.
