# Step-by-Step Guide to Kick-Off AI-Driven Development for QuickTechPro

## 1. Consolidate Requirements

Begin by gathering and organizing all features, pages, workflows, and security must-haves from the six attachments into a single, prioritized product backlog. Group items by milestone:

- Milestone 1: Core public pages (home, services, contact, booking) and authentication
- Milestone 2: Customer portal basics (dashboard, ticket creation/list, payments)
- Milestone 3: Admin portal basics (dashboard, ticket management, user management)
- Milestone 4: Blog, content moderation, quotations
- Milestone 5: Analytics, multi-agent support, enhancements (live chat, knowledge base)


## 2. Define User Stories \& Acceptance Criteria

For each backlog item, write a clear user story and acceptance criteria. Example:
“As a visitor, I want to see accurate service pricing on the Pricing page so that I can decide whether to book.”
Acceptance: Pricing table displays correct fees for remote, onsite, and web-dev services; mobile-responsive; loads under 3 s.

## 3. Design Architecture \& Tech Stack

Use the opinionated full-stack:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + React Query + Socket.io
2. **Backend**: NestJS (REST + GraphQL) on Node.js, Passport.js for JWT/OAuth2
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis (session/cache + BullMQ)
4. **Storage**: AWS S3 for uploads; SendGrid/MSG91 for notifications
5. **Deployment**: Docker + GitHub Actions → Vercel (frontend), AWS ECS (backend)

Draft a high-level architecture diagram showing API, database, cache, storage, and client apps.

## 4. Establish Development Workflow

- Set up GitHub repo with branches “main” and “develop.”
- Configure CI/CD: lint, tests, security scans → push develop → deploy dev environments.
- Define sprint cadence (2 weeks): sprint planning, daily standups, demo, retrospective.


## 5. Scaffold Projects

1. **Frontend**: `npx create-next-app quicktechpro-web` → install Tailwind, React Query, Socket.io-client, React Hook Form, Yup.
2. **Backend**: `nest new quicktechpro-api` → install Prisma or TypeORM, Passport, BullMQ, AWS SDK.
3. **Mobile**: `expo init quicktechpro-mobile` → configure React Native, FCM, secure storage.

## 6. Configure Authentication

- Implement email/password signup with verification link.
- Add SMS OTP via MSG91 for critical flows.
- Layer Passport.js JWT strategy and OAuth2 for social login.
- Enforce RBAC guards in NestJS.
- Build login/signup UI components in Next.js.


## 7. Build Core Public Pages

1. Homepage, Services, About, Contact, Pricing – static Next.js pages with Markdown-driven content.
2. Booking form (`/book-service`) with multi-step wizard, Razorpay integration, pincode check via Google Maps API.
3. SEO meta tags, schema markup, responsive breakpoints.

## 8. Develop Customer Portal

- Secure routes under `/customer` in Next.js.
- Dashboard: fetch ticket summaries, invoices, blog CTA via REST.
- Tickets: list, detail, creation flow (multi-step form), file uploads to S3.
- Payments: integrate Razorpay checkout widget and webhook handlers in NestJS.
- Blog: rich text editor (Draft.js or TipTap) + image uploads + submit for review.


## 9. Build Admin Portal

- Secure routes under `/admin` (Next.js or a separate React app).
- Dashboard: chart remote vs. onsite tickets; recent events feed via GraphQL.
- Tickets: advanced filters, bulk actions, internal notes.
- Users \& Roles: management UI, assign roles, view sessions.
- Content moderation: approve/reject blog posts, manage categories.
- Quotations: template builder, PDF generation via BullMQ job.


## 10. Implement Notifications \& Real-Time

- WebSockets (Socket.io) for in-app alerts (ticket updates, new quotes).
- Email templates via SendGrid: ticket creation, status changes, blog approvals.
- SMS alerts for urgent statuses and 2FA.


## 11. Integrate Analytics \& Monitoring

- Add Google Analytics 4 to public and portal UIs.
- Instrument backend with OpenTelemetry; export to Grafana/Prometheus.
- Configure Sentry for error tracking in frontend and backend.


## 12. Testing \& Security

- Write Jest unit tests for backend services and React Testing Library tests for UI.
- Cypress end-to-end tests for key flows (signup, ticket, payment).
- Run OWASP ZAP in CI for vulnerability scanning; use Snyk for dependency checks.
- Configure rate limiting, CSRF tokens, CSP headers, secure cookies.


## 13. Deployment \& Go-Live

- Use Terraform to provision AWS resources (VPC, RDS, ElastiCache, ECS).
- Deploy frontend to Vercel; backend Docker image to ECS Fargate.
- Set up DNS and SSL with Let’s Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager.
- Run smoke tests and load tests (Artillery) before traffic cutover.


## 14. Post-Launch Monitoring \& Iteration

- Monitor SLAs (response times, uptime) via Grafana.
- Collect user feedback; triage bugs and enhancements into the backlog.
- Plan support rotation for multi-agent operations and ongoing content/calendar updates.

***

By following these steps—organizing requirements, defining architecture, scaffolding projects, implementing features in prioritized milestones, and enforcing best practices in testing, security, and deployment—you’ll equip an AI/pair-programming agent or developer team to build QuickTechPro from scratch with clarity, efficiency, and scalability.
