# Comprehensive Plan for a Computer Repair & Web Development Support Portal

Comprehensive Plan for a Computer Repair & Web
Development Support Portal
Overview
You  are  planning  a  web-based  platform  (with  accompanying  mobile  app)  that  combines  IT  support
ticketing, remote assistance, onsite service requests, small web-app development requests, and a user-
driven blog. The goal is to provide a seamless experience where customers can log in, raise support tickets
or  project  requests,  make  payments,  and  interact  with  content,  while  the  admin  can  manage  tickets,
payments,  content,  and  more  from  a  unified  portal.  This  document  provides  an  in-depth  analysis  of
features,  navigation  structure,  technology  stack  recommendations,  security  considerations,  dashboard
design, and user/admin workflows for the proposed system.
Core Functional Features
1. Ticketing System for IT Support
Multiple Ticket Types:  Users can create tickets for:
Remote Support:  Issues resolved online. The system should require upfront payment during ticket
creation (integrate Razorpay for payments).
Onsite Support:  Issues requiring a technician’s visit. The portal must check the user’s location (e.g.,
via provided address or postal code) to ensure it’s within Bangalore  or other supported areas before
allowing an onsite request. If outside the service area, inform the user of options (like shipping the
device or limited support availability).
Web App Development Requests:  Users can submit project details for custom web development.
This acts as a request for quotation rather than an immediate support issue.
Easy Ticket Submission:  The ticket submission form should be quick and user-friendly, asking only
necessary details to avoid overwhelming the user . Keeping the form simple encourages customers to
submit issues without frustration . For example, a remote/onsite support ticket might ask for a
short description of the issue, category (if applicable), urgency, and contact info, whereas a web
development request form might ask for project type, requirements summary, and budget/timeline
expectations. (Keeping ticket creation straightforward is key to user satisfaction .)
File Attachments:  Allow users to attach relevant files to tickets (screenshots of errors, photos of
hardware issues, documents). This helps technicians diagnose problems faster . Implement server-
side validation for file types (e.g., images, PDFs, logs) and size limits.
Ticket Tracking:  Once logged in, users can view the status of their tickets in their dashboard:•

Status could include New , In Progress , Awaiting Payment  (if applicable), Pending Customer Info ,
Resolved/Closed , etc.
Users should get notifications (email and/or in-app) when their ticket status updates (e.g., technician
assigned, issue resolved, comment from admin, etc.).
Communication & Updates:  Each ticket should have a thread or log for communication:
The admin/technician can post updates or requests for more info.
The user can reply with additional details or comments.
This keeps all the context in one place. Optionally, allow internal notes (visible only to admins/
agents) on tickets for internal tracking of work or collaboration (a common helpdesk feature ).
Remote Support Process:  For remote support tickets (after payment confirmation):
The system should display instructions or a scheduled session time for remote assistance. (e.g.,
“Your ticket is paid. Our technician will contact you at the scheduled time. Please have AnyDesk or
Quick Assist ready.”)
The admin can log the remote session details in the ticket (time connected, actions taken).
After resolution, the admin marks the ticket Resolved  and may include a resolution summary.
Onsite Support Process:  For onsite tickets:
If the user is eligible (location in Bangalore), allow ticket creation for onsite service. The user should
provide their address and preferred dates/times.
The admin can schedule a visit (coordinate via phone or in-app messaging). The scheduled
appointment info can be recorded in the ticket.
Payment for onsite could be handled in two ways: either collect upfront for a consultation fee or
allow payment after service completion. In either case, the system should support creating an
invoice for the visit.
If the user is outside the service region, the system can either prevent onsite request or prompt an
alternative (e.g., “You are outside our onsite service area. You may ship your device to us or choose
remote support if applicable.”). Admin can provide shipping instructions if needed (this could be a
separate Offsite Repair  ticket type or handled via onsite requests with special notes).
Web Application Development Requests:
A specialized form for project inquiries where users provide details about the web app they need:
key features, intended users, any specific technologies or preferences, and so on.
Upon submission, the status might be Under Review . The admin reviews the requirements, possibly
communicates with the client for clarification through the ticket thread, and then prepares a
Quotation .
Quotation can be generated within the system (semi-automated): based on service type or project
complexity, the system might have templates or baseline pricing that the admin adjusts. For•

example, the admin selects a service category and the system suggests a price range which the
admin can refine.
The quotation (with pricing breakdown, taxes, and terms) is sent to the user (perhaps as a PDF
attachment or an entry in the ticket visible to the user).
The user can approve the quote through the portal. Once approved, the admin can convert it into a
project ticket or mark it as Accepted  and then arrange further steps (like payment milestones
outside or inside the system as needed).
If the user declines or requests modifications, that feedback can be managed in the ticket comments
and a revised quote can be issued.
Ticket Closure and Rating:  After a ticket is resolved (remote/onsite) or a project delivered:
The ticket is marked Closed/Resolved . The system can prompt the user to provide a rating and
review  for the service. For example, a 5-star rating and an optional comment about their experience.
These reviews could be visible to admin (for testimonials) or even displayed (with admin approval) on
the website as social proof.
Closed tickets along with their details should remain accessible in the user's account for reference,
and to the admin for records and analytics.
Search and Filter:  For both users and admin, include the ability to search and filter tickets:
Users might filter their tickets by status or date.
Admin can filter by ticket type (remote vs onsite vs dev), status, customer , priority, etc.
This is helpful as the number of tickets grows.
Priority and SLA:  Introduce priority levels (Low, Normal, High, Urgent) that users or admin can set
for tickets. While you might not implement formal SLA timers initially, tagging priority can help the
admin queue work. In future, you could implement response time targets for high priority issues.
Multi-Channel Ticket Creation (Future):  In later iterations, consider allowing tickets via email or
phone:
Email-to-Ticket:  Setting up a dedicated support email where incoming emails auto-create tickets is a
common helpdesk feature .
Phone/Manual:  Admin should be able to create a ticket on behalf of a customer who calls in, so all
issues are tracked. This would be done through the admin portal (quick ticket creation interface).
2. Payment and Billing Integration
Upfront Payment for Remote Support:  Integrate Razorpay  for handling payments. When a user
selects “Remote Support” and submits a ticket, they should be prompted to pay (either a flat fee or
an estimated fee for the service). Only after payment is successful is the ticket officially logged as
Open  for admin to address. Use Razorpay’s APIs/checkout to securely handle this transaction. The
portal should record the payment status and transaction ID with the ticket for verification.•

Location-Based  Tax  Calculation:  Ensure  that  applicable  taxes  (GST,  etc.)  are  calculated  during
checkout. For instance, if your business is registered in Karnataka, India, charging a customer within
India  would  typically  involve  GST.  Razorpay  or  your  backend  can  calculate  taxes  based  on  the
customer’s location or the predefined tax rules. Since onsite services are limited to Bangalore (same
state), intra-state GST would apply; for remote support or development services provided online, you
may need to charge IGST for out-of-state customers. Implement a system to add the correct tax line
item on invoices based on the billing address or location of the customer at checkout.
Quotations & Invoices:  For any billable service:
Quotation:  As discussed for web development projects (and possibly for complex onsite jobs), the
admin can generate a quote. This could be facilitated by selecting predefined service items from a
list (with associated costs) to build the quote, which the system then totals up including taxes. The
quote is then shared with the customer via the portal.
Invoice Generation:  After a service is completed or a ticket is closed (especially for onsite services
where payment might happen post-service, or for project milestones), the system should generate
an invoice. The invoice will detail the services provided, hours or units (if applicable), cost, taxes, and
total. It should have a unique invoice number , date, and due status (if not already paid).
For remote support, since payment is upfront, the invoice can be auto-generated upon payment
confirmation. It can be available for the user to download (as PDF) from their dashboard and
emailed to them.
For onsite support, if payment is collected after service, the admin can mark the ticket as Ready for
Payment  which triggers an invoice and a payment link via Razorpay. The user can pay online
through the portal. Alternatively, if payment is collected offline (cash/card on site), the admin can
mark it paid and still provide the invoice in the system.
Receipt and Records:  Ensure each transaction is recorded. Users should see their payment history
and be able to download invoices/receipts for all services. Admin should have a financial view to
track all payments received, pending payments, and generate reports (e.g., total revenue in a period,
taxes collected, etc.).
Razorpay Integration Considerations:  Razorpay provides web integration (checkout popups) and
mobile SDKs. Use their APIs to:
Collect payments securely (never store raw card details on your servers – Razorpay handles that).
Handle webhooks for payment status updates. For example, update the ticket status to "Paid" upon
receiving a successful payment webhook to guard against any edge cases (like user closed the
window but actually paid).
Support multiple payment modes (UPI, credit card, netbanking) out of the box via Razorpay, which
improves user convenience.
Refunds and Cancellations:  Implement a process for refunds if necessary. E.g., if a remote support
ticket cannot be resolved or is canceled within a policy window, the admin should be able to trigger a
refund via Razorpay and the system reflects the ticket as canceled/refunded.•

3. Onsite Service Area Validation
Because onsite services are limited to Bangalore , incorporate a mechanism to verify the user's
location:
During user registration or profile setup, you might require an address with pincode. The system can
check that the pincode or city equals Bangalore (or a list of allowed pincodes/areas). If not, the user
can still register (for remote services or blog), but if they attempt to raise an onsite ticket, the system
should alert that onsite service is unavailable in their area.
Alternatively, at the time of creating an onsite ticket, ask the user to enter the service address (auto-
fill with profile address if available). Then validate this input. The simplest check is matching city or
zip code against allowed list. A more advanced approach could integrate Google Maps API to allow
the user to pick a location or to verify distance from your base location.
If the address is within Bangalore: proceed with ticket. If not: either disallow with a polite message
or offer the device shipment  option. For device shipment cases, you might still allow ticket creation
but mark it as  Offsite Service  and provide instructions (like an address to ship the device, or a
prompt for the admin to follow up with shipping arrangements). Ensure the user understands they
may bear shipping costs and turnaround time will include shipping.
Service Area Settings:  In the admin portal, include a setting to manage serviceable locations. Today
it’s Bangalore; in future, if the business expands to other cities, admins could update this list or rules
without code changes. This could be as simple as maintaining a list of allowed city names or zip
codes in a config section.
4. User Registration and Account Management
User Registration:  Users (customers) should sign up with basic details – name, email, phone,
password, and perhaps address (especially if they may request onsite service). Verify the email (send
confirmation link) to ensure authenticity. Optionally, verify phone via OTP for added trust (could
integrate an SMS API if needed).
Login/Authentication:  Secure login for users and admin. Implement role-based access control  –
regular users vs. admin accounts have different permissions . Only admins can access the admin
dashboard and management features.
Social Logins (Optional):  To simplify onboarding, you could allow social logins (Google, Facebook)
for users. However , ensure you still collect necessary info like phone or address after social login (via
a profile completion step) since those aren’t always provided by OAuth.
Profile Management:  Users can update their profile information: name, contact, address, password
reset, etc. Make sure to validate and secure these endpoints (especially changing email/password
should require re-authentication or confirmation for security).
Role Management:  In the admin side, there should be ability (perhaps in future when scaling) to
create additional admin or support agent accounts. Roles might include:
Admin/Owner:  Full access to everything (manages tickets, payments, blog approvals, system
settings).
Support Agent/Technician:  Limited admin who can view and manage tickets, but maybe not
change system settings or approve blog posts. (Since initially only one admin handles all, this can be
a future expansion.)
Content Moderator:  If you ever had a separate role just to manage blog posts/comments.•

Implementing granular role-based access ensures no unauthorized actions (e.g., only the owner can
change pricing settings, etc.) .
Customer  Login  Experience:  Once  logged  in,  customers  should  land  on  a  Dashboard  (see
Dashboard section below) from where they can create new tickets, view their existing tickets, and
interact with blog or comment features. If a user attempts to do certain actions without login (like
raising a ticket, commenting on a post), redirect them to login/signup.
5. Blog and Content Management
Blog Listing and Categories:  The platform should have a public-facing Blog  section where articles
are posted. These can be guides, tech tips, news, or user-contributed articles. Organize the blog by
categories or tags (e.g., Repair Tips , Tech News , How-Tos , Web Development , etc.) to help users navigate
content.
User-Contributed Posts:  A distinguishing feature is allowing logged-in users to write blog posts and
submit them for admin approval:
Provide an interface (accessible to logged-in users) to "Write an Article" . This could be a rich text
editor form where they can input a title, body content, and optionally assign categories/tags.
Support image uploads  in the blog content – users can attach an image to their post (for example,
an illustrative photo or screenshots for a how-to article). Those images should be stored securely on
the server (or a cloud storage) and inserted into the post content.
When a user submits a blog post, its status is Pending Review . The post is not publicly visible yet.
Admin Review & Approval:  In the admin portal, there should be a Blog Management  section (or
Content Moderation ) where the admin can see all pending blog submissions:
Admin can click into a submission, review the content for quality, relevance, and ensure no
inappropriate material.
The admin can then Approve  or Reject  the post. If approved, the post becomes live on the blog. If
rejected, the admin can optionally provide feedback to the author (perhaps via a notification or a
note attached to the submission) about why it was rejected (e.g., “topic not relevant” or “content
needs improvement”).
The admin should also be able to create and publish their own blog posts from this interface (for
content the business owner writes, like announcements or service updates).
Editing and Formatting:  Admin might occasionally want to polish a user-submitted post before
approval. Implement an admin ability to edit the content or fix formatting, to maintain a high quality
of blog content.
Once approved and published, a post should show the author (could be the user's name or a generic
"Guest Author" depending on preference). Giving credit encourages users to contribute more.
Blog Post View & Interaction:  Users (logged in or even guests, depending on your preference –
though you may allow anyone to read posts, not necessarily logged in) can view the published blog
posts:•

Each post page shows title, author , content, images, publish date, categories/tags.
Comments:  Logged-in users should be able to comment on blog posts. A comment form at the
bottom of a post allows the user to add their thoughts or ask questions. These comments could also
go through a moderation queue or at least have the ability for admin to delete if something is
inappropriate. (Spam prevention via requiring login may be enough initially, but a CAPTCHA or
Akismet-like spam filter can be considered if it becomes an issue.)
Likes/Shares:  Optionally, allow users to “like” a post or share it (integration with social media share
buttons).
Search : Implement a search function for the blog so users can find articles by keywords.
Image Handling:  Since blog posts allow images:
Add support in the text editor for uploading an image (this could be handled by an uploads API
endpoint that stores the file and returns a URL to embed in the post content).
Store images in a directory or a cloud bucket (like AWS S3 or Cloudinary) to manage load. The system
should create appropriate thumbnails if needed for blog listing pages.
Ensure the images are sanitized (no executable code), and perhaps impose a max file size to prevent
extremely large files.
Content Management System (CMS) Features:  Though this is a custom portal, implementing some
CMS-like features will help:
Drafts:  Users writing posts might want to save a draft and come back later . Support saving a post in
draft status for the author before they submit for review.
Revision or Versioning:  Not mandatory initially, but it’s good if the admin’s edits or multiple
versions of a post are tracked (even simple version history).
Publishing Controls:  Admin can schedule a post to go live at a certain time if needed (not a must-
have, but a useful addition).
Categorization:  Admin  should  manage  blog  categories  (add/edit/delete  categories  or  tags).
Consistent categories ensure the blog stays organized.
SEO  Considerations:  Ensure  blog  URLs  are  clean  (e.g.,
/blog/how-to-fix-overheating-laptop  rather  than  an  ID  query)  and  that  you  include
metadata (title, description) for sharing. This will help the blog content attract visitors via search
engines, potentially bringing in new customers.
6. Additional Features & Enhancements (Suggested)
Beyond the core features described, here are some  must-haves or nice-to-have enhancements  for a
professional, robust system:
Knowledge Base / FAQ:  Consider creating a section for help articles or common troubleshooting
guides  (distinct  from  the  blog,  which  is  more  general).  A  knowledge  base  allows  users  to  find
answers to common issues before  raising a ticket. This can reduce the number of basic tickets and
empower users with self-service. Integration of a knowledge base with the ticket system is beneficial•

– e.g., suggesting relevant help articles when a user is creating a ticket based on keywords .
Initially, this could be part of the blog or a static FAQ page with topics like "How to use Quick
Support" or "Preparing for a remote session".
Live Chat Support:  While not initially requested, a live chat widget can be a great addition for quick
help. This could either connect to you or available agents for real-time support or use a chatbot to
answer simple queries and direct users. Live chat offers another channel of support alongside the
ticket system , though it requires someone to actively manage it. If resources allow, this can
improve user experience by handling minor issues or guiding users to create a ticket if needed.
Multichannel Notifications:  Implement email notifications for key events (in addition to in-app
notifications):
When a ticket is created, send the user a confirmation email with ticket ID and details.
When the admin/agent responds or updates status, send an email to the user .
When a quote is provided, email the user to check the portal.
When a blog post is approved/published, maybe notify the author .
And of course, email receipts for payments.
Using a service like SendGrid or a reliable SMTP server with templates will help maintain professional
communication. Keep the emails concise and informative.
Admin-to-Customer Messaging:  Apart from ticket comments, provide a way for admin to message
the customer through the platform for any general queries or announcements. Perhaps a simple
messaging feature or at least include an admin email/phone in the portal for the customer to reach
out directly if needed.
Reviews/Testimonials Page:  If you gather user reviews after ticket resolution, consider showcasing
positive testimonials on the website (with permission). A page with customer feedback can be great
for marketing and trust building. The system could allow the admin to mark certain feedback as
"featured" and display them (with or without the customer’s name as desired).
Device/Inventory Tracking:  In case you plan to handle hardware (like if customers send devices for
repair), an inventory or asset management feature could be useful. For example, logging the device
serial number , status (received, under repair , shipped back) in the ticket. This is more relevant if the
volume increases, but something to consider later .
Analytics & Reporting:  Over time, having reports will be valuable:
Number of tickets per month, breakdown by type (remote vs onsite vs dev requests).
Average resolution time.
Revenue reports (from Razorpay payments) – total earnings, taxes, etc.
Customer base growth (new registrations over time).
These can be shown in admin dashboard as charts or exported to CSV for analysis. While not critical
on day one, designing the database with these in mind will help (e.g., having timestamps and status
fields to calculate resolution times).5

Scalability for Multiple Agents:  Currently one admin handles all tickets, but plan for the future:
Allow assigning tickets to specific support agents (if new staff are added). The ticket view can show
who is responsible.
Possibly an internal escalation path – e.g., if a ticket is open too long, or is marked urgent, some alert
to ensure it's addressed.
Role-based features as discussed allow adding more agents safely .
Mobile App Features:  Since a separate mobile app is desired from the start, ensure features are
accessible on mobile:
The app (Android/iOS) should allow users to do all key actions: create tickets, view status, pay via
Razorpay (likely through Razorpay’s mobile SDK or webview), and read/write blog posts or
comments.
Push Notifications can be enabled in the mobile app for instant alerts on ticket updates or new
messages.
For admin, a mobile app (or at least a responsive web admin) could allow managing tickets on the
go, which is very useful for field technicians . A technician on-site can update the ticket from their
phone, for example.
You might develop the mobile app using a cross-platform framework (see Tech Stack below) to reuse
code and speed up development.
Performance and Scalability:  As the portal grows:
Use caching for frequently accessed data (like the blog homepage, or a list of services) to improve
response times.
For the ticketing system, ensure queries are optimized (indexes on ticket status, user ID, etc., for fast
dashboard loading).
Use a CDN for serving images (like blog images or any content) for faster loading globally.
Design the architecture to handle concurrent usage – e.g., multiple users raising tickets at once, or
heavy blog traffic if a post becomes popular . This might influence the choice of tech stack (Node and
Django can handle scale, but you might consider load balancers or cloud services as you grow).
Geographic  Expandability:  Currently,  services  focus  on  Bangalore.  If  planning  to  expand
geographically:
The system’s location-check mechanism should be flexible (perhaps by simply changing allowed
regions or by linking each ticket to a service center location).
Perhaps in future allow user to choose a city or pick from multiple service centers, and have tickets
route to different queues based on city. While not needed now, a design mindful of this can save
refactoring later .•

Navigation Structure
Design the navigation menus for both the main user-facing site and the admin portal to be intuitive, as
seen in professional web apps. Here’s a suggested breakdown:
Main Website Navigation (Customer-Facing)
Your main site’s top menu should cover all primary user needs and informational pages. For example:
Home:  A landing page highlighting your services (remote IT support, onsite support in Bangalore,
web app development, etc.), maybe a brief overview of how the process works, and some
testimonials or featured blog posts.
Services:  A section that describes each service offering in detail. This could be a dropdown with
items:
Remote Support  – Explain what remote support covers, maybe pricing or plans.
Onsite Support  – Details about onsite visits (service area, process).
Web Development  – Info on small web app/dev services, how to request a quote.
Alternatively, separate Pricing  page if you have fixed rates for certain tasks (though many repair
tasks are case-by-case).
Support/Tickets:  This menu item takes users to the support portal section:
If not logged in, it prompts login/signup (perhaps showing a “Login to Raise a Ticket” message).
If logged in, it could directly go to My Tickets  or a “New Ticket” page. You might break it into sub-
items: Raise a Ticket , My Tickets .
Blog:  Link to the blog home page. This is a public section showcasing all published blog posts.
Logged-in users within the blog can also get a button like "Write a Post" (taking them to the
submission form).
About Us:  Information about the company/person (since this might be a personal business). Include
background, qualifications, why choose this service, etc. This builds trust.
Contact Us:  A page or section with contact details (phone number , email, office location in
Bangalore). You can include a contact form for general inquiries. Also include operating hours for
support.
Login/Signup:  If the user is not logged in, a prominent login/register button. Once logged in, this
might be replaced by a User Menu  (often an icon or username dropdown on the top right) with
options:
Dashboard  (or My Tickets)
Profile/Account Settings
My Blog Posts  (if you want to let users see a list of their submitted posts and statuses)
Logout .
Footer Navigation:  Often, repeated links of the above plus maybe Terms of Service, Privacy Policy,
social media links, etc., for completeness.
The main navigation should be simple and clear so that customers immediately see where to go for help
(tickets) and can find info about services and blog content.•

Admin Portal Navigation
The admin interface should have a sidebar or top menu that allows the owner/agents to efficiently manage
the system. Typical sections might include:
Dashboard:  The overview page (see Dashboard section for details of what to show). This is the home
screen for admin after login – showing ticket stats, notifications, etc.
Tickets/Support:  The core section for support tickets. It can have sub-sections or filters:
All Tickets  (list with filters by status, type, etc.).
Maybe quick views like Open , In-Progress , Closed  for convenience.
Clicking a ticket opens the Ticket Detail  view, where the admin can see full history, post updates,
change status, assign to someone (if multiple agents), verify payment, etc.
If volume grows, also consider sub-menus for Onsite Requests , Remote Support , Web Dev Projects  for
category-specific views (though a unified list with filters might suffice).
Quotations:  A section to manage quotations sent for web development or complex jobs:
List of pending quotations, accepted, rejected.
Or this could be integrated with Tickets (since quotes are linked to tickets). Another approach is that
a web dev “ticket” goes through a Quote sub-status. Whether separate or integrated, ensure admin
can find all quotes easily.
Invoices/Payments:  A financial section:
List of invoices (paid and unpaid).
Ability to view details of each invoice, mark as paid if an offline payment was received, or trigger
sending a reminder .
Possibly integration to generate reports (total income, taxes, etc. over periods).
This could tie into Razorpay’s data or your own records.
Blog Management:  Manage all blog content and user submissions:
All Posts:  List of published blog posts (with ability to edit or unpublish if needed).
Pending Approval:  List of blog submissions awaiting review.
Maybe Categories/Tags:  manage the taxonomy.
Possibly Comments:  if you want to moderate user comments, a view to see recent comments with
ability to remove or block spam.
User Management:  View and manage user accounts:
List of all registered users/customers.
Ability to view their profiles (ticket history, blog posts contributed).
Option to deactivate or ban a user if needed (e.g., someone posting spam).
Password reset or set roles (like promote another user to an agent role if needed in future).
Settings:  Various configuration settings for the system:
Service Settings:  define categories of tickets, default pricing or options (e.g., maybe set a default rate
for remote support or list of common issues).
Location Settings:  as mentioned, manage allowed service locations or any distance radius for onsite.
Payment Settings:  Razorpay API keys, tax rates, currency (likely INR).
Email/Notification Settings:  templates for automated emails, turning on/off certain notifications.
Security Settings:  enable 2FA for admin, manage roles and permissions.
Appearance/Content:  if needed, settings for site branding (logo upload) or footer texts, etc.
Announcements (Optional):  If you want to send announcements or newsletters to users (for
example, “We will be closed during a holiday” or general updates), an admin section could facilitate•

that. It might just be part of blog or a separate announcements feature that shows a banner for
users.
Reports:  If implementing reporting dashboards, an admin menu for Reports:
Could have submenus for Tickets Report (with filters by date range, etc.), Financial Report, etc., or
simply a page where admin can select report type and parameters.
This can come later; initially, basic stats on Dashboard might suffice.
The admin portal navigation should be designed for efficiency – e.g., a clear indicator if there are new
pending tickets or blog posts (a badge with count). Also ensure the admin UI is mobile-responsive or have a
mobile app, since technicians might use it on the go .
Technology Stack Recommendations
Building a web platform with a corresponding mobile app and a need for reliability and security suggests
using a modern, robust tech stack . Given the requirements, here are some suggestions:
Web Application
Front-End (Web):  Use a dynamic front-end framework for a responsive, app-like experience in the
browser .
React  (with Next.js) – for a component-based approach and server-side rendering (Next.js) which can
improve performance and SEO (useful for the blog and marketing pages). React has a vast
ecosystem and developers readily available.
Angular  – a full-fledged framework that could be used if your developer prefers. Angular is well-
suited for building large applications with built-in routing, state management, etc.
Vue.js  – another approachable framework, good for gradual integration. Vue could work well
especially if the team wants something lighter than Angular but more structured than raw React.
All of these can produce a responsive interface and allow creating a Progressive Web App (PWA) . A
PWA could complement or even substitute a separate mobile app initially by enabling “installable”
web app behavior on mobile devices.
Back-End:  You need a server-side that exposes APIs for both the web front-end and mobile app to
use, handles business logic, and interacts with the database.
Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)  – Very popular for web apps. Using frameworks like Express.js
(minimal and flexible) or NestJS  (which provides a structured, Angular-like architecture with
TypeScript) can speed up development. Node’s non-blocking, event-driven nature is ideal for
handling multiple requests and real-time updates . If you plan features like live chat or instant
notifications, Node is well-suited for websockets.
Python  – Known for its simplicity and readability . A framework like Django  could be a great
choice as it’s “batteries-included” (comes with an admin interface, ORM, authentication system, etc.
out of the box). Django would allow rapid development of secure web features and has a built-in
admin panel that could be leveraged for managing data. Alternatively, Flask  could be used for a
lighter , more customizable approach, though more setup would be needed compared to Django.
Python also has good Razorpay library support and is generally efficient for such business logic.•

Java / Spring Boot  – a bit heavier , but if enterprise-grade solidity is needed and the developer is
comfortable, Spring Boot can handle large scale and provide a strong structure. Possibly overkill for
a small business project unless future expansion is huge.
C# / .NET Core  – a viable option especially if targeting Windows environments. .NET Core is cross-
platform now and can be used for web APIs. It’s powerful, but your team needs to be fluent in it. It
could integrate nicely if you had any Microsoft-specific plans, but otherwise Node/Python stacks are
more common for this scenario.
PHP (Laravel)  – Laravel is a very popular PHP framework that could also fit this project well. It has a
gentle learning curve, many packages (including for payments, etc.), and comes with its own
templating and backend structure. Many IT support sites or portals have been built with PHP
historically. Laravel’s ecosystem could allow fast development (e.g., packages for helpdesk or blog
exist). If your developer is proficient in PHP, this stack can be quite hassle-free.
When choosing, consider developer expertise and community support.  For quick development
with lots of built-ins  (auth, admin UI, etc.), Django or Laravel shine. For full flexibility and modern
JS throughout , Node.js with Express/Nest plus a React front-end is excellent.
Database:  Choose a reliable database to store users, tickets, comments, etc.
Relational DB : Given the structured data (users, tickets, payments, blog posts with relationships like
comments to posts, tickets to users), a SQL database is a good choice. PostgreSQL  or MySQL/
MariaDB  are solid. PostgreSQL offers robustness and features (JSON fields if needed for flexible
data). MySQL is very popular and well-supported. Both have ORMs in whatever backend framework
you choose (Prisma or TypeORM for Node, Django ORM for Python, Eloquent for Laravel, etc.).
NoSQL : If you anticipate highly unstructured data or massive scale with real-time updates (like a live
chat with high volume), you might add a NoSQL DB. For example, MongoDB  (document store) could
be used, especially if using a Node/MERN stack. However , core features here fit well in SQL. Mongo
could be used for something like storing activity logs or caching certain data. It’s not strictly
necessary, but some developers prefer it for flexibility.
Others : If using cloud services, something like Firebase  could manage the backend (auth, database)
but given the custom nature (tickets, payments, etc.), a custom backend with SQL is better . You can
host on a cloud DB service (AWS RDS, etc.) for reliability.
Server and Deployment:
During development, you can start simple (a single server running the backend, serving the front-
end or separate static front-end). In production, consider using cloud platforms:
AWS / Azure / Google Cloud  – you can deploy backend on an EC2 or use container services
(Dockerize the app and run on AWS ECS or Kubernetes). Use managed DB services as mentioned.
If using Node/React , you might deploy the frontend on a CDN (Netlify, Vercel for Next.js for
example) and deploy the backend separately.
If using Django/Laravel , they can serve both backend and frontend together (server-rendered
pages) or provide APIs.
Containers : Using Docker for both app and db can ease deployment and scalability.
Ensure environment variables are used for sensitive config (DB credentials, Razorpay keys, etc.) and
not hard-coded.•

Integration APIs:
Razorpay (for payments) – use official SDK or REST APIs from server side to create orders, verify
signatures of payments, handle webhooks.
Email service – integrate with an SMTP or a service like SendGrid/Mailgun for sending emails (for
notifications, verifications).
SMS service (if using OTP for phone verify or sending SMS alerts) – integrate with an SMS gateway
like Twilio or any Indian SMS provider (e.g., MSG91) for OTP and alerts.
Possibly a location API – if you want to auto-detect user location for onsite eligibility (HTML5
geolocation or IP-based detection to suggest, but verification should rely on address).
AnyDesk/Remote tool integration – not much to integrate since you’ll use it externally, but you could
generate session codes or links if any API exists. Likely, it’s outside the system scope – just ensure
instructions and maybe a field to record “AnyDesk ID” of the user in the ticket could help.
Mobile App:  You indicated wanting a separate mobile app at the outset. There are two primary
approaches:
Cross-Platform Development:  Use a framework that allows one codebase for both Android and iOS:
Flutter : Google’s Flutter uses Dart and allows building beautiful native-compiled apps for
both Android and iOS (and even web). It’s efficient and has good packages (including for
Razorpay, which provides a Flutter plugin, and for making network calls to your backend).
React Native : If you already use React on web, React Native lets you reuse some skills. It’s
also widely used and has libraries for Razorpay integration and so on. It might allow sharing
some code or at least patterns with the web React app.
Ionic (with Angular/React) : Ionic + Capacitor allows building a web app and packaging it as
a mobile app. Since you are anyway building a web front-end, Ionic could leverage that
investment. However , pure native performance might be slightly less, though for a ticketing
app it’s usually fine.
Native Development:  Build separate apps in Kotlin (Android) and Swift (iOS). This ensures best
native performance but doubles the work. Probably not necessary for an app of this scope where
cross-platform solutions work well.
The mobile app will essentially be a client to the same backend APIs. Ensure you design a clean RESTful (or
GraphQL) API that both the web and mobile can use. For example, endpoints for login, creating tickets,
listing user’s tickets, posting blog content, etc. Use JSON data format for communication. Secure the API
with tokens (e.g., JWT or OAuth tokens) and secure storage of those tokens in the app.
Real-time Communication:  If you want live updates (say admin updates a ticket and the user’s
screen reflects it instantly), consider using  WebSockets  or  server-sent events . Technologies like
Socket.io (for Node) or Django Channels (for Django) can enable this. It’s not a must-have initially;
you can rely on periodic refresh or push notifications for mobile to signal updates. But planning for it
means possibly using a framework that supports real-time (Node is good at this, or Pusher service as
a third-party option).
Testing:  Choose a stack with good testing frameworks. For instance, if using Django, use its built-in
testing tools; for Node, use Mocha/Jest, etc. Ensure critical functions (like payment handling, auth,
and ticket flows) are covered by automated tests to prevent regressions.•

“Without much hassle” : To interpret that – pick a stack that your development team is comfortable
with and that has plenty of libraries for common tasks (auth, payments, etc.). If your developer is not
deeply familiar with newer JS frameworks, a safer choice could be something like Laravel  or Django ,
which handle many things out of the box and have a lower learning curve for full-stack development
(plus large communities). If the developer is proficient with JavaScript, a  MERN stack (Mongo,
Express,  React,  Node)  might  be  very  productive.  Evaluate  the  team’s  strength  and  the  local
developer availability in Bangalore; many are versed in Node and PHP stacks, and Python is also
popular in the community.
Security Mechanisms
Security is critical, given the portal will handle user personal info, support details (which might be sensitive),
and payment transactions. Implement multiple layers of security:
Authentication & Authorization:
Use a proven auth system (don’t roll your own from scratch if possible). Frameworks like Django/
Laravel have built-in auth. For Node, use Passport.js or similar for robust auth handling.
Password Storage:  Store passwords hashed (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) – never in plain text.
Session Management:  If using sessions/cookies, ensure they are secure (HttpOnly, Secure flags,
proper session expiration). If using JWT for API auth, use strong secrets and expiration times, and
refresh tokens if needed.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):  For admin accounts, definitely enable 2FA (for example, an OTP
via email/SMS or an authenticator app) on login for an extra layer of protection . For users, it can
be optional, but you might implement OTP SMS verification during sign-up or when performing
sensitive actions.
Role-Based Access Control:  As mentioned, enforce that admin-only APIs and pages can only be
accessed by admin roles . This includes server-side checking of roles on each request. Never rely
solely on hidden front-end links – always validate permissions on the backend as well to prevent
Broken Access Control  issues .
Input Validation & Sanitization:
All user inputs (ticket descriptions, profile info, blog post content, comments, etc.) must be properly
validated and sanitized to prevent injections.
SQL Injection:  Use parameterized queries or ORM methods for database interactions . This
avoids attackers injecting malicious SQL via forms.
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):  Since users can post content (especially blog posts and comments), be
very careful. Implement output encoding for any user-generated content displayed. In blog posts,
allow HTML but filter it – use a library or service to clean HTML (whitelist of allowed tags) so that
scripts cannot run. Similarly, for comments or ticket inputs, you might allow only plain text or a very
restricted set of HTML. This ensures no malicious script can be injected and execute in someone
else’s browser .
File Uploads:  Scan or at least validate file types by extension and MIME type. Store user uploads
(images) in a separate directory (or bucket) not executable by the server . When displaying images,
serve them via a different domain or with correct headers to prevent any malicious file acting as
script.•

URL/Path Traversal:  If allowing file downloads (like invoice PDFs), ensure proper access controls so
one user cannot download another’s file by tweaking a URL.
Protection against Common Vulnerabilities:
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):  Use CSRF tokens in forms (frameworks often provide this) to
prevent unauthorized commands from malicious sites.
Clickjacking:  Use frame-busting headers (X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN) so your portal
cannot be embedded in an iframe by a malicious page.
Content Security Policy (CSP):  Consider setting a CSP header to restrict loaded resources,
mitigating XSS by only allowing scripts/styles from your own domain.
HTTPS Everywhere:  Ensure the site is served exclusively over HTTPS. Obtain an SSL certificate (Let’s
Encrypt or any CA) and enforce secure connections. This is crucial for protecting login credentials
and any sensitive data in transit.
Secure Cookies:  If using cookies for session, mark them Secure (HTTPS only) and HttpOnly (not
accessible via JS) to reduce XSS stealing cookies. Set SameSite to Lax or Strict to mitigate CSRF.
Encryption & Data Protection:
Follow best practices for sensitive data. For instance, if storing any personal info like addresses, it’s
fine in DB, but if storing something sensitive (passwords – hashed as said, payment data – actually
do not store card details at all, leave that to Razorpay; if storing any API keys or secrets, keep them
out of code and in environment configs).
If you store files (like user-uploaded images or invoices), ensure the storage is not publicly writable,
and access is controlled.
Regularly back up the database (with secure storage for backups). Also, encrypt backups or at least
secure them since they contain all user data.
Payment Security:
Rely on Razorpay’s secure checkout for handling card details (which you will). Ensure verification of
payment signatures if Razorpay requires (to confirm payment responses are legitimate and
untampered).
Be compliant with any relevant standards – in India, Razorpay will handle PCI compliance aspects,
but ensure your implementation of their SDK is as per their latest guidelines (tokenization, etc.,
which they enforce).
Display trust signals on the site (like “Secure payment via Razorpay” etc.) to assure users.
Audit Trails:
Log important actions: user logins (success/failure attempts), ticket creation, payments processed,
admin actions like changing ticket status or editing a blog post.
These logs help in both debugging issues and detecting any unauthorized activity. For example, if a
user account was compromised, you could see unusual actions in logs.•

Keep admin logs for content approval as well, so you know which admin approved what (especially
when multiple admins exist in future).
Use  a  centralized  logging  approach  (store  logs  in  files  or  use  a  service)  and  monitor  errors/
exceptions for quick response.
Prevent Brute Force:
Implement rate limiting on login attempts (e.g., max 5 attempts per 5 minutes per IP) to prevent
brute force password cracking.
Possibly integrate a CAPTCHA after several failed attempts or on registration forms to thwart bots.
API Security:
If you have a separate API (for mobile), secure it with tokens and HTTPS. Use proper authorization
checks on each endpoint.
If using JWT, ensure to validate the token signature and expiry. Use short-lived tokens and refresh
tokens if needed to minimize risk.
Avoid exposing sensitive information via APIs. Only return what’s necessary for the client. E.g., when
a user fetches their ticket list, they shouldn’t see any tickets that aren’t theirs by manipulating
parameters  (again,  check  userId  against  token  for  every  such  request  –  a  common  mistake  is
trusting client inputs too much).
Compliance and Data Policies:
Though this is a small business webapp, be mindful of data protection laws (India has proposed
personal data protection rules, and if any chance of international use, GDPR etc.). Basic compliance
would mean having a clear privacy policy, letting users delete their account (and data) upon request,
etc. This isn’t a tech feature per se, but mention it to the developer to keep data practices
transparent and secure.
Ensure emails and phone numbers are kept private (not exposed to other users). For example, if
comments show user names, maybe avoid showing full email to prevent scraping.
Security Testing:  Before launch, perform thorough testing:
Use tools or scripts to test for SQL injection, XSS (there are free scanners or OWASP ZAP for
instance).
Code review for security by an experienced developer if possible.
Keep libraries and frameworks up to date to patch known vulnerabilities .
By implementing these mechanisms, you significantly reduce the risk of breaches and build trust with users
that their data and transactions are safe on your platform. Security is an ongoing process, so plan for
regular updates and reviews of the system’s security posture.•

Dashboard Design and Information
Both customers and admin users will have dashboards tailored to their needs. Here’s what each should
contain:
Customer Dashboard (User Portal)
When a user logs in, the dashboard homepage  gives a quick overview and access to key functions:
Welcome Header:  Greet the user by name, perhaps with a friendly message or tagline (“Welcome
back, [Name]! How can we help you today?”).
Ticket Summary:  A section summarizing their support tickets:
Show the number of Open  tickets and maybe the number of Closed/Resolved  tickets for reference.
A quick list of active tickets with key info: Ticket ID, title/issue summary, current status, last update
time. Each item clickable to view full details.
A prominent button “Raise New Ticket”  for quick access (possibly with icons for remote, onsite, dev
request to choose from).
Quotes/Invoices:  If the user has any pending quotations or outstanding invoices, highlight them:
e.g., “1 Quotation awaiting your approval” with a link to view it.
“1 Invoice due for payment” if, say, an onsite service was done and awaiting payment online.
This ensures the user notices any action items right away.
Blog & Community Section:  Encourage engagement:
If the user is someone who might contribute or comment, show maybe recent blog posts or a CTA
like “Write a new blog post” especially if they have contributor privileges.
Possibly show latest 2-3 blog titles with thumbnails to drive traffic to content (this doubles as soft
marketing for your services too, if posts are helpful tips).
If the user has submitted blog posts, show their status (e.g., “Your recent post ‘XYZ’ is awaiting admin
approval” or “Published on [date]”).
Reviews/Feedback Prompt:  If the user has any recently closed ticket that they haven’t reviewed,
prompt them (“How was our service for Ticket #12345? Rate us.”). This could appear as a card on the
dashboard until they submit feedback or after a certain time.
Profile Shortcuts:  A small section or sidebar showing the user’s profile info (with an edit link). E.g.,
“Member since 2025, Email: [email], Phone: [phone].” And a link to Account Settings.•

Announcements:  If  admin  posts  any  announcements  (like  maintenance  times,  new  service
offerings, special promotions), display those on user dashboard. This can be a dismissible banner or
a sidebar list.
Support Resources:  Perhaps a link to an FAQ or knowledge base (“Looking for quick help? Check our
[FAQ] or [Knowledge Base].”) This can reduce tickets by deflecting common questions.
Overall, the user dashboard should make it easy for them to start a request, see what’s happening with
their issues, and engage with the content/community.
Admin Dashboard
The admin’s dashboard is the mission control. Upon login, the owner/admin should see a comprehensive
snapshot and shortcuts:
Ticket Stats Cards:  Show key metrics upfront:
Number of Open Tickets  (perhaps broken down by type: X remote, Y onsite, Z web dev).
Number of Tickets Pending Payment  (if any cases where payment is not done yet for a request).
Number of Overdue Tickets  (if you have any SLA or expected resolution times, or any that have
been open too long).
Closed Tickets This Week/Month  as a productivity measure.
These could be small cards or a section with counts and maybe color coding (e.g., red if any urgent
tickets overdue).
Latest Tickets or Notifications:  A feed or list of the most recent ticket events:
e.g., “Ticket #1045 opened by [user] – Remote Support – awaiting your action”,
“Ticket #1040 updated by customer – needs response”,
Or simply a list of newly submitted tickets and those updated in the last X hours.
This helps the admin quickly identify what needs attention right now.
Pending Blog Posts:  A notification or list for content moderation:
E.g., “3 new blog submissions awaiting approval”. Clicking would go to the moderation queue.
Possibly also flag if any new blog comments need review (if you implement comment moderation
where first-time comments must be approved or so).
Statistics/Charts:  Visual elements to show trends:
A simple graph of tickets created vs. closed per day/week (helps visualize workload and
performance).
Pie chart of tickets by category (to see what kind of issues are most common – e.g., 50% remote
support, 30% onsite, 20% dev requests).•

Maybe a chart of monthly revenue from support services (tickets) and projects. This gives a business
health overview at a glance.
Quick Actions:  Buttons or links for frequent admin actions:
“View All Open Tickets” (maybe the most common page).
“Create New Ticket” (in case a call-in comes, the admin can log it).
“Go to Blog Approvals”.
If your system sends newsletters or announcements, a “Send Announcement” quick link.
These shortcuts save clicks in navigating the sidebar for highly used tasks.
Search Bar:  A universal search that could allow admin to quickly find a ticket by ID or user by name/
email, etc. This can be at top of dashboard for convenience.
System  Health/Admin  Notes:  If  relevant,  an  area  for  admin  messages.  For  example,  if  some
integration is failing (like email server down – if you can detect that, show a warning). Or simply a
place the owner can leave notes for staff (if multiple agents) like “Reminder: Scheduled maintenance
on Friday”.
Upcoming Appointments:  If onsite visits are scheduled (and if you add a calendar scheduling
component), show the next few upcoming appointments (ticket ID, customer , date/time) so the
admin/technician can prepare.
Agent Performance (if multi-agent):  Not needed if only one admin, but if later multiple agents
exist, the dashboard might show something like “Tickets assigned to you” vs global, and maybe
some performance indicators (like average closure time, etc.).
Interface Layout:  Typically, admin dashboards use a card-based layout for the above, possibly in a
grid. It should be responsive as well. For example, top row with 3-4 stat cards, a main section with a
ticket list or chart, side section with other info.
Importantly, the dashboard should be customizable to some extent or at least well-organized so the admin
can get a comprehensive overview without digging through menus. This “at a glance” view helps ensure
nothing slips (like a forgotten ticket or an unapproved blog post).
User and Admin Workflow Scenarios (Story Mode)
To illustrate how the system will work, let’s walk through typical scenarios from both a customer’s and the
admin’s perspective:•

Customer Journey Example
Meet Alice , a freelance designer in Bangalore who has a laptop issue and also an interest in tech blogging.
Here’s how Alice interacts with the portal:
Discover & Sign Up:  Alice finds the website through a web search or referral. On the homepage, she
sees the description of services. She clicks  “Login/Sign Up”  to create an account. She fills in her
name,  email,  phone,  password,  and  receives  a  verification  email  to  confirm  her  account.  After
verifying, she logs in.
Raising a Remote Support Ticket:  Alice’s laptop is running very slow. After logging in, she hits
“Raise a Ticket” on her dashboard.
She chooses Remote Support  (since it’s a software issue). The portal presents a form: she enters a
title (“Laptop running extremely slow”), a description (“My laptop has become very sluggish over the
past week. Possibly malware or too many startup programs.”), and selects category  (perhaps
“Performance Issue”).
She sees a note that remote support has a fixed fee of, say, ₹500. She submits, and the system
redirects to payment via Razorpay. Alice pays using UPI. The ticket is now created with status Open/
Paid .
She immediately gets an email and SMS confirming her ticket #123 is open and paid.
Back on the site, the ticket page shows details and a note: “Our support team will contact you
shortly. Please have AnyDesk installed for the remote session.”
Interaction & Resolution:  Within 10 minutes, Alice’s phone rings (or she gets an email update). Bob
(the admin/technician) has updated the ticket: “Hi Alice, I’m ready to assist. Please open AnyDesk and
share your session code here.” Alice sees this update in the ticket thread on her portal and also got
an email notification.
She replies on the ticket thread with the AnyDesk code. Bob connects to her machine, diagnoses the
issue (some heavy background processes and malware).
During the session, Bob might add internal notes on the ticket (not visible to Alice) like “Removed
malware X, optimized startup, ran disk cleanup” for record-keeping.
After 1 hour , the issue is fixed. Bob updates the ticket status to Resolved  with a public comment:
“Resolved: Removed malware and cleaned up system. Performance is back to normal. Please restart
and confirm.”
Alice gets notified of the resolution. She restarts her laptop and it’s indeed fast again.
Closure & Feedback:  Alice is happy. She clicks  “Close Ticket”  (or the ticket auto-closes after 24
hours of no response). The system prompts her to rate the service. She gives 5 stars and writes
“Excellent support, my laptop is running great now!” This feedback goes to the system (visible to
admin and maybe appears as a testimonial).
Requesting Onsite Support:  A month later , Alice’s desktop PC won’t turn on. She logs in and raises
another ticket, this time choosing Onsite Support .1.

The system already has her address (Bangalore) from her profile. She confirms it and selects a
preferred date/time for the visit (tomorrow afternoon). She describes the issue (“Desktop not
powering on, possibly PSU issue”).
Since onsite isn’t prepaid, the ticket is created as Open - Pending Schedule  or similar . She’s told “We
will confirm your appointment shortly.”
Bob (admin) receives the ticket, checks that it’s within service area (it is), and updates the ticket:
“Scheduled visit on [Date] 3:00 PM. Please ensure someone is available at your address. Payment can
be made after service.” The ticket status might change to Scheduled .
Alice sees the confirmation in her portal and also gets an email with the appointment details.
Bob visits on the scheduled time, fixes the desktop by replacing the PSU. He updates the ticket on his
mobile after the job: “Replaced power supply, system is working now. Invoice generated.” He marks
it Completed .
Alice receives an invoice in the portal (and email) for the service (cost of PSU + labor , with taxes). She
goes online, opens the invoice, and clicks Pay Now  (Razorpay link). She pays, and the ticket updates
to Closed - Paid .
She again leaves a review for this ticket in the portal. All her past tickets are accessible in her
dashboard for reference.
Web Development Inquiry:  Alice is also thinking of a small web project (a portfolio site). On the
portal, she sees under Services a section for Web App Development. She clicks Request a Quote .
A form appears asking for project details: she fills out that she needs a personal portfolio site with a
blog, expecting ~5 pages, and would like it done in 1 month.
She submits this as a Web Dev Request . The ticket (or request) goes to admin as Quote Requested .
Bob reviews it, and through the ticket’s thread asks a couple of questions (“Do you need e-
commerce? Any design references?”). Alice replies via the portal.
Bob then uses the system’s Quotation feature to create a quote: he selects a “Portfolio website
package” template, customizes the features list, sets a price of ₹15,000 and 2-week timeline. The
system includes 18% GST, so total ~₹17,700. He sends the quote through the portal.
Alice gets notified of the quote. She reviews it in her account, and accepts it (there’s an “Accept
Quote” button). The system now might either prompt for a deposit payment or simply notify that
Bob will contact to start the project.
(If a deposit is required, say 50%, the system could integrate that: generate an invoice for ₹8,850,
which Alice pays, then the remainder later . Let’s say it’s implemented.)
After acceptance, Bob and Alice proceed outside the system to work on the project (or maybe Bob
could use an integrated project tracker , but that’s beyond current scope). Once done, Bob marks the
quote as Project Completed  and issues the final invoice which Alice pays through the portal.
Blog Contribution:  Meanwhile, Alice writes a helpful article on “5 Tips to Keep Your Computer Fast”.
She goes to the Blog  section and clicks “Write a Post” .
She enters a title, writes her 5 tips in the rich text editor , and uploads a nice cover image. She
submits it for review.
The status shows as “Pending Approval”. After a day, she checks and sees it got approved and
published (she might also get an email “Your post has been published!”).14.

She can now share the link with friends, and other users can comment on it. One user comments
asking about one of the tips; Alice replies to the comment – building a little community interaction,
all within the portal.
Throughout  Alice’s  journey,  the  portal  provided  a  unified  experience:  whether  she  needed  support  or
wanted to contribute content, everything was accessible with one login. She feels engaged and taken care
of, which increases her loyalty to the service.
Admin (Owner) Journey Example
Bob is the owner/admin (and currently the sole technician and content moderator). His experience revolves
around managing incoming requests efficiently:
Morning Check-in:  Bob logs into the Admin Portal  each morning. On his Dashboard, he
immediately sees:
2 new tickets opened overnight (one remote, one onsite request).
1 ticket awaiting customer info.
1 blog post pending approval.
Key stats: e.g., 5 open tickets total, no overdue tickets (good news), and maybe a chart showing a
steady increase of tickets this week.
Processing New Tickets:  He clicks on the first new ticket (remote support from Alice):
He sees that payment is received (the system shows “Paid via Razorpay, ₹500, Txn ID ...”).
He reads the issue description. Using the contact info provided, he could call the customer if needed,
but since the platform allows comments, he posts a response in-ticket asking for the AnyDesk code.
He sets the ticket status to In Progress  and perhaps assigns it to himself (since he is the only agent,
assignment might be implicit).
Bob then continues to the next ticket.
The second new ticket is an onsite request: - It’s from a new user whose address is in Bangalore, which is
fine. Bob checks the preferred schedule, and cross-checks his calendar (the system might integrate or he
manually ensures availability). - He updates the ticket scheduling it for tomorrow and confirms with the
customer via a ticket comment (which triggers an email to them). He might also call to confirm address
details, then notes in the ticket “Confirmed by phone”. - This ticket will remain open until the visit is done.
Bob might also add it to his personal calendar .
Resolving Tickets:  Bob then addresses any In Progress  or Awaiting Info  tickets:
For the one that was awaiting customer info (say he had asked someone for a laptop model
number), he sees the customer replied. He proceeds with the solution and resolves it.
He keeps an eye on any due/urgent ones. If any ticket has been open too long, he might prioritize it
or send a follow-up message to the customer .
Onsite Service:  In the afternoon, Bob goes to perform the onsite service scheduled for Alice’s PC.32.

Before leaving, he prints or notes the ticket details (address, issue). Possibly, the system could
generate a simple work order printout from the ticket.
After the job, he uses his phone to access the admin site (mobile-responsive) and updates the ticket:
“Job done, replaced PSU”. He marks it completed and triggers the invoice.
Using the integrated Razorpay dashboard or the admin portal’s invoice section, he sees if Alice paid
the invoice later . (He might also allow her to pay by card on the spot via a mobile POS, but that would
be external and he’d mark it paid manually).
The admin invoice section now shows that invoice as pending until payment is confirmed. Once Alice
pays online, Bob receives a notification and sees the invoice marked Paid .
Quotation Handling:  Bob also sees a web development request (like Alice’s portfolio site inquiry):
He opens the request ticket, reads the requirements. Through the portal’s Quotation builder , he
selects predefined line items for a basic website, customizes the description, and sets the price. The
system calculates tax. He sends the quote with one click.
The ticket is now marked as Quote Sent . He’ll wait for Alice’s response. Meanwhile, it’s listed in a
“Quotations” view as pending.
Alice accepts the quote, Bob gets notified. The quote view now shows it as accepted. Bob calls Alice
to discuss the project kick-off. He also sees that the system generated a 50% deposit invoice which
has been paid. This financial transaction is recorded in the Payments section.
Blog  Moderation:  Next,  Bob  navigates  to  Blog  Management  to  review  the  pending  post
submission:
He reads Alice’s article on keeping computers fast. It’s well-written and relevant. He maybe fixes a
couple of formatting issues (the editor allows admin to edit the post before publishing).
He clicks Approve . The post is now live on the site. Bob might add a comment on the post as well,
thanking Alice for the contribution.
If the post had issues, he could have rejected it with a note (“Please add more details on point 3,”
etc.), which the system would relay to the author for revision.
He also quickly scans recent comments on blog posts. Let’s say all are fine, but if he noticed any
spam or off-topic comment, he’d delete it via the admin interface.
Ongoing Monitoring:  Throughout the day, Bob keeps the admin portal open:
If a new ticket comes in, he gets a notification (could be a sound or just the dashboard updating if he
has it open, and an email to him as admin).
He promptly addresses it depending on priority.
He also checks the Analytics/Reports  section in a free moment to see how business is doing. For
example, he sees this month he resolved 30 tickets, a 20% increase from last month. Remote support
is the majority, and revenue from remote support is X, from onsite Y, from dev projects Z.
Using this info, he might decide to adjust his availability or maybe plan to hire another technician if
growth continues.5.

Admin Settings:  Occasionally, Bob might use the Settings section:
He updates the “service areas” list if he decides to include a neighboring city.
Or he updates a pricing template (e.g., raises the base remote support fee).
He ensures Razorpay API keys are current and tests a dummy transaction in a staging environment
after any library updates.
He also enables two-factor auth for his account via an authenticator app, given the sensitivity of the
admin access.
Logout:  At day end, Bob logs out from the admin portal, confident that all tickets are handled or
queued appropriately, content is moderated, and the system is up-to-date.
This  story  illustrates  how  the  platform  streamlines  operations:  Bob  can  handle  everything  from  one
interface – support tickets, scheduling, billing, content – rather than juggling separate systems. It also
shows the end-to-end flow of how a customer issue gets logged and resolved with transparency for the
customer and control for the admin.
Conclusion
In summary, this portal will integrate multiple facets of an IT service business into a cohesive system: ticket
management , payment processing , on-site service coordination , quotation and invoicing , blog-driven
community  engagement ,  and  a  clear  distinction  between  customer  and  admin  experiences.  By
implementing the features and best practices described – along with a thoughtful UI/UX (easy navigation,
dashboard overviews) and robust security measures – you will have a professional, scalable platform. Both
customers and the admin/agents will benefit from efficiency and clarity, leading to improved customer
satisfaction and streamlined business operations.
This document can serve as a blueprint for developers or an AI system to start architecting the solution. Be
sure to consider the technology stack capabilities and team expertise, and follow the security guidelines to
protect the system. With this groundwork, you’ll be set to build a successful support and service portal that
can grow with your business.
